Implement the core functionality of the dialog component

Note: This implementation is not yet complete.
Most notably it is missing the animation of the dialog. 
The translation of the attribute based original with its rendering cycle to a SolidJS component has some challenges.
A full implementation of this component makes sense once the original is stable.
